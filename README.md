# Benford's Law apps implementation

This reports is for learning purposes and will contain apps implementing [Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law) in diferent technologies.

The purpose of this is not to validate if the algorithm works well or bad, it is just an excercise to learn diferent platforms and practice TDD (Test Driven Development).
I should see that practicing TDD is not a bad way to learn the basics and deepers things of a platform.

Currently it is only implemented in iOS with Swift as is the platform I am learning.

Hope you enjoy this!

Happy coding!
